        <p>Hey there,</p>
        <p>My name is Henry and welcome to my portfolio. On here you will find a lot of the work that I have done
            through my years of programming, but before we get that far allow me to tell you a little bit about me. </p>
        <p>I am a 20-year-old junior software developer that has been writing programs since the age of eight. Ever
            since I was little, I have always been a huge fan of technology, a passion that carries on to this day. I am
            always trying to stay knowledgeable of the latest advances and creation of new and existing technologies
            from the simplicity of basic electronics to the massive LLM and AI models that are now everywhere.</p>
        <p>Python is my language of choice due to its huge flexibility in software development, from a simple web server
            to advanced AI models. Iâ€™ve been using it for the past 12 years while also advancing my knowledge of other
            languages such as C# in unity to create games for desktops and VR, Arduino C++ to make my creations come to
            life with Arduinos and ESP32 modules, and some web development using HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
        <p>My favourite programming projects are ones that can be applied to physical hardware such as robotics. Seeing
            your code working on a screen is cool enough once you have squashed all the bugs, but for me to see it
            moving or affecting something in the real world or even making it so that the real world is affecting the
            virtual one just makes the experience of a finished script so much better.</p>
        <p>Privacy is another important thing for me. I believe everyone should have the right to control what was saved
            and shared around. That is why all the code I developed over the years will only track and save data that it
            needs to function. If a feature is turned off, then any data specific to that function would not be
            recorded.</p>
        <p>Below I have listed some of the projects that I have worked on. Sadly, some of them I have now had to stop
            development on them since I do not believe that there is any use for them, but I still believe in what I
            have made could be useful to people. I may bring projects back in the future once knowledge has strengthened
            enough so that I can make them the best they can be.</p>
