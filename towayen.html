        <p>An easy-to-use weather app that will provide user tailored experience. I wanted to create my own weather app
            that could provide user tailored information about the day. It would know when someone might get cold based
            off factors such as temperature and then recommend that they wear a jumper.</p>
        <p>This project is still early so I have not been able to make much progress so far.</p>
