        <p>Starting out as my A-level project it has now become a fully fledged Discord bot. The project was initially a
            learning experience for me. I wanted to learn how to properly use an API, web sockets and get into some web
            development. Using all the different request types and accounting for rate limits, which is why one of my
            other projects “Discord-API-Limits” was created. With this project I also had to learn about web sockets to
            get real time information from Discord about new messages for example.</p>
        <p>For the website I used flask since it is a well-known web framework for python with lots of documentation and
            a strong community that I could reply on for assistants. The web dashboard allowed for all aspects of the
            bot to be easily configured and tweaked.</p>
        <p>For Googly I created the following features:
        <ul>
            <li>Welcome/Leave messages. Useful to let the server know when new people join their community. Welcome
                messages could also be configured to send a DM to the new user.</li><br>
            <li>Custom prefix. Before slash commands where introduce on Discord bots used prefixes to know whether a
                command for them had been sent, this is not used today but I have still left it as part of the bot
                encase people prefer the old way (I do).</li><br>
            <li>Message logging. This can be extremely useful for admins and moderators of a server. Whenever a message
                is edited or deleted, the original message would be sent in the form of an embed message to a specified
                channel.</li><br>
            <li>Anti-spam. Another useful tool for admins and mods, this stops people from sending repeated messages
                across a server. This is now unfortunately not needed since Discord has created their own implementation
                since I added this feature.</li><br>
            <li>Auto-Threads. This is a feature that allows for threads to be automatically created from a message is
                a specified channel. The tread would then be named based off what was said in the first message in the
                new thread. This is useful for servers that have help channels, allowing them to remain neat and tidy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There are more features that I have planned for the future.</p>
        <p>At the moment Googly Bot is offline while I do a complete overhaul of the code and web dashboard.</p>
