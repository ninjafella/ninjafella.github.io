        <p>Public networks are nowhere near as safe as you own personal network at home. There are people that can and
            listen into your traffic and see what you are doing. Even the place who owns the networks, e.g. caf√© or
            hotel, can see what going on.</p>
        <p>I was on holiday and the hotel network as no privacy between devices. I had taken my Googly TV stick with me
            to watch Netflix and Disney+ in the evening, but people kept on casting to it.</p>
        <p>This is where I had the idea to create Privacy Pi. A small little device that would be the device you connect
            to the public network, you then connect all your devices to it, and it would hide them from public view. I
            also wanted to add the functionality of using a VPN connection back to wherever you wanted, like back home,
            to provide extra security. </p>
        <p>One of the main benefits is that you do not have to connect each of your devices to the public network. As a
            member of a family of four with all our gadgets and phones it can just be a real pain to add them all one by
            one. But not with this. </p>
        <p>With Privacy Pi the Wi-Fi network that it would create could be the same as your network at home so
            everything just immediately picks it up, all you have to do is connect the Privacy Pi to the public network
            through its own web dashboard that could only be accessed through the hotspot network not through the public
            one.</p>
        <p>The prototype I had made featured a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 due to how compact it is, a custom PCB that I
            designed and had manufactured by JLCPCP, a small OLED display that allowed for basic information to be
            easily viewed and some settings tweaked using 3 buttons located next to the OLED display.</p>
        <p>Sadly, I did not have the believe that I could do more than the prototype at the time. While the system did
            work it was slow (likely due to the Pi Zero 2 performance) but I do not currently have the necessary
            knowledge to develop my own network device.</p>
